# Apple Retail Sales Analysis

## Objective
This is a solo data analysis project created by Zachary K King simply to try and get more practice and improve my skills as an aspiring data analyst. My goals for this project are to analyze Apple product, store, and regional revenue performers to identify growth opportunities and operational inefficiencies.

## Tools Used
-Python (pandas, duckdb, matplotlib/plotly)
-Jupyter Notebook
-SQL (DuckDB)
-Kaggle retail dataset

## Key Questions
-Which products generate the most/least revenue?
-Which stores and countries outperform or underperform?
-Are there seasonal or regional demand patterns?
-How can Apple optimize pricing, inventory, or store allocation?

## Results
(Will fill in after Notebook Completion, and when insights are finalized)

## Repository Structure
-'Data/' -- raw datasets
-'Notebooks/' -- primary analysis notebook
- 'Scripts/' -- supporting/SQL logic files

## Status
Work in progress - visualization and final insights in progress.

All of the data was gathered on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amangarg08/apple-retail-sales-dataset

Any and all feedback is greatly appreciated
